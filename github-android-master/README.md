## Building

The build requires [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
v3.1.1+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/tools/android-sdk
```

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

* Run `mvn clean package` from the `app` directory to build the APK only
* Run `mvn clean install` from the root directory to build the app and also run
  the integration tests, this requires a connected Android device or running
  emulator

You might find that your device doesn't let you install your build if you
already have the version from Google Play installed.  This is standard
Android security as it it won't let you directly replace an app that's been
signed with a different key.  Manually uninstall GitHub from your device and
you will then be able to install your own built version.

See [here](https://github.com/github/android/wiki/Building-From-Eclipse) for
instructions on building from [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org).
