Deprecated
===============

This library is deprecated and won't be supported any longer. Instead, I would suggest you to use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/DrawerLayout.html">DrawerLayout</a> which is supported by Google and follows their design guidelines.

AndroidSideMenu
===============

AndroidSideMenu lets you create side (slide\drawer, whatever you call it) menu without special effort.

![Example](https://raw.github.com/dmitry-zaitsev/AndroidSideMenu/master/screenshot.jpg)

Why this one is better than others? Because it works much faster (thanks to caching), so it's doesn't matter how complex your layouts are.

<b>Note</b> that this library <b>doesn't</b> provide tools for creating menu itself, you are free to put inside menu whatever you want (ListView? LinearLayout? RelativeLayout? ImageView? ...)

Installlation
=============

Add .jar file to build path.

Usage
=====

There is no need to extend another Activity, all you have to do is wrap your layout in SlideHolder widget like this:

	<com.agimind.widget.SlideHolder
		android:layout_width="match_parent"
		android:layout_height="match_parent">
		
		<!-- Here is any view that will represent your side menu. Don't forget to provide width! -->
		<View 
			android:layout_width="300dp"
			android:layout_height="match_parent"
			/>
		
		<!-- And here is your main layout -->
		<View 
			android:layout_width="match_parent"
			android:layout_height="match_parent"
			/>
			
	</com.agimind.widget.SlideHolder>
	
Note, that you should provide fixed width for your menu (in xml or programmaticaly).

On big devices (tablets in landscape orientation) consider always show side menu using this method:

	setAlwaysOpened(true);
	
SlideHolder also supports revers swipe (from right to left). To enable this feature use:

	setDirection(SlideHolder.DIRECTION_RIGHT);
