/**
 * This class provides the primary API for managing all aspects of Wi-Fi
 * connectivity. Get an instance of this class by calling
 * {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService(String) Context.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE)}.

 * It deals with several categories of items:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The list of configured networks. The list can be viewed and updated,
 * and attributes of individual entries can be modified.</li>
 * <li>The currently active Wi-Fi network, if any. Connectivity can be
 * established or torn down, and dynamic information about the state of
 * the network can be queried.</li>
 * <li>Results of access point scans, containing enough information to
 * make decisions about what access point to connect to.</li>
 * <li>It defines the names of various Intent actions that are broadcast
 * upon any sort of change in Wi-Fi state.
 * </ul>
 * This is the API to use when performing Wi-Fi specific operations. To
 * perform operations that pertain to network connectivity at an abstract
 * level, use {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager}.
