Description: Lightweight Android library to read parts of RSS 2.0 feeds.

== Installation ==

Fetch the source code with Git:

  git clone https://ahorn@github.com/ahorn/android-rss.git

Alternatively, you can download the sources from github.com/ahorn.

To reference the downloaded library from within your Android mobile app,
navigate to the <sdk>/tools/ directory and use the following command:

  android update project \
    --target <target_ID> \
    --path path/to/your/project \
    --library path/to/android-rss

This command appends to the "default.properties" file in your Android
project a new "android.library.reference" property. The value of this
new property should be the relative path to the directory which you
created when you fetched the Android RSS library source code.

Henceforth, android-rss is compiled when ant builds the app which was
specified in the --path argument above.

However, Eclipse does not work using this method because it does not
reference anything that is not an Eclipse project. When you try to
transform android-rss into an Eclipse project you encounter errors
due to the testing directory. To fix these, you have to change the 
source directory by editing the .classpath file to set "/src/main/java"
as the source folder.
